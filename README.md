In this analysis, ARIMA model construction is explored on a data set analyzing rail freight carloads. Recorded on a monthly basis, and taken between the months of January 2000 through December 2022, 276 observations were recorded. With the model displaying seasonal trends, the data was respectively massaged for both seasonal and non-seasonal first differences. These procedures assisted in making the model stationary, with some outlying variance concerns still existing around the year 2020. When assessing the ACF and PACF plots of the differenced data, there showed no significant non-seasonal lags; however, there were significant seasonal lags at lag(12) in the ACF plot, and lag(12), lag(24), and lag(36) in the PACF plot. As such, applying parsimony to our model exploration, models with seasonal term Q = 1 were considered first before introducing additional terms P∈ [1,2,3]. For our non-seasonal terms, different combinations were explored that gave strong diagnostic results for normality of residuals, and also strong point estimates for parameters. Brining in the best candidate models, six were chosen and reviewed for selection based on Akaike’s Information Criterion, Akaike’s Information Criterion (small sample adjusted), and Bayesian Information Criterion. In the end, an ARIMA (1,1,1) x (0,1,1)_12 model was chosen based on the strength of its small number of variables and lowest BIC criterion amongst models with seasonal and non-seasonal terms. A forecast 12 months into the future from January 2023 through December 2023 was created. Layering the model over historical data, the fit was determined to be decent. Observations of the model showed that volatility around economic disruptions (pandemic, recession, monetary contraction, etc..), may recommend a different model framework using GARCH or “Long Memory” ARIMA.
